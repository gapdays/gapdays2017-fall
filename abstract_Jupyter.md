title: Update on all things Jupyter, LibGAP, Racket-GAP

### Markus Pfeiffer

I will give an overview of my ongoing work and future plans for
the GAP Jupyter kernel, my efforts to make it possible to use GAP as a
library (which some call LibGAP), and my recent efforts to implement GAP
(and more) in the programming language racket.

These topics are all connected, and also don't warrant talks of their
own, hence they all go into one.
