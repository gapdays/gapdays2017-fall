### Generating matroids using HPC-GAP and ArangoDB

A matroid is a fundamental structure occurring in various fields of
mathematics, such as combinatorics, algebra and optimization. It
generalizes the notion of linear dependence in linear algebra.  In
this talk, we will describe a general framework of parallelized
iterators which can be applied to generate matroids parallely. Other
applications include e.g. the generation of phylogenetic trees.  This
approach is implemented in HPC-GAP and we will also show experimental
results and run times. Finally using the new ArangoDB GAP package, we
have established a database of matroids which can be used for future
experiments quickly.  This is joint work with Mohamed Barakat, Reimer
Behrends, and Chris Jefferson.
