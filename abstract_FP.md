title: Proving finitely presented groups to be hyperbolic in polynomial time

### Markus Pfeiffer

... is of course impossible: It is undecidable whether a finitely presented
group is hyperbolic. "So, why bother?", you might think. One response is
"Because we want to know!"

Small cancellation techniques have successfully been applied to
determine hyperbolicity of finitely presented groups.

We present an algorithm (and its implementation) due to Parker,
Neunh√∂ffer, Holt, Linton, Roney-Dougal, and others, which generalises
small cancellation and terminates in polynomial time and either proves
hyperbolicity (and even gives a word-problem solver), or provides
evidence for why it was not able to prove it.
