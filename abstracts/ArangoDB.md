### ArangoDB

In this talk I will give an overview of ArangoDB, a native multi-model
distributed database. I will explain what this means and in which way
ArangoDB stands out among the many other databases on the market. I
will in particular cover similarities and differences to classical
SQL-based relational data stores.

In the second part I will show a live demo and thereby explain about
documents, collections, AQL queries, the ArangoDB shell, the web UI
and basic usage. I will also say a few words about deployment (single
server/cluster, laptop/cloud, binary packages/Docker, etc.).
